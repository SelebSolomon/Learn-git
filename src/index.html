            <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">A next step in this journey is producing the oil. For this purpose, the fruit bunches are treated with steam. this is an important step as it eliinates any bacteria and puts a stop to enzyme activity. in this way, the degradaton of the fruits is brought to an end.

                in the meantime, the steamer softens the oil palms fruits, which in turn helps to relieve the natureal il. After this steams treatment, the fruit masses, which contains water, oil, fibers, palm kernel are treated to separate all components.
                
                This natural fruits is then put under high pressure to squeeze out the oil and water. As a result, a water-oil mixture is produced. As water and oil do not mix after sometime, the oil will form an oil layer on the top. in this way, the oil can be then extracted from the water. hat it finally results are the first drops of natural crude palm oil. Tis will need furter process at the refinery.</p>
